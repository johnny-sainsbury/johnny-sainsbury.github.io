            <br><br><em>My personal ethics are present in the background of my thoughts and actions often.</em> Usually they feel invisible or natural till something butts up against them and calls them into question. Because of this, who I surround myself with and what I do day-to-day can feel like ethical decisions. There have been points in time where people in my community don’t treat others with or themselves with kindness. I’ve had to make difficult decisions to communicate with them about this. These are not easy conversations to have and I prefer them sparingly, but I believe sticking to these values fortifies the strength of your wider community.  

            <br><br><em>I am part of a creative queer community, very often driven by music and visual arts.</em> In this world fluidity is important and I enjoy actively avoiding dogmatism, gathering people from all walks of life with all types of value sets around me. Because my culture has never been strictly defined or categorised I have formed an affiliation with the values and identities that have struck a chord with me slowly over time. This process influenced me in the sense that I now see values and identity as malleable - able to change over time depending on what is important at the present. Living this way has meant I also extend that same freedom to others. I do not apply sets of expectations to people based on the identity they present, which is a value in and of itself.
            
            <br><br><em>During my career development I have observed that I can be tripped up by anxiety and distractions.</em> On the flipside, I’ve noticed that I am someone who takes genuine deep interest in the things around me. Whether it is social or task oriented I tend to engage deeply and humanely. I hope this strength applies to learning obstacles while at Dev Academy, I can see myself taking time to understand the instructors and co-learners around me, and taking genuine interest and joy in the technical problems I solve.

            <br><br><em>My background is in the fashion industry. Broadly speaking there are tendencies for this to be fast paced, emotional, and image driven.</em> Often this means there are many people working to strict deadlines around me in a mixture of visual and technical rolls, which can cause social conflicts and tensions in the office. I have a tendency to want people around me to be happy, so I always try to lighten the mood and check in with my co-workers as to what is going on in their role and what is causing them stress. I’ve found this effective in the past, but going forward I think it is also important to provide material support where possible - taking small tasks off their plate if they are overloaded. Trying other people’s jobs helps you empathise with them more in the future, and also to pick up on new skills.
