            <br><br><em>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the measure of a person’s ability to have awareness and understanding of their own emotions and others around them.</em> It also measures their application of said emotions in “real life” situations - for example, when facing challenges in the workforce or in study.

            <br><br><em>EQ differs greatly from IQ both in terms of what it measures and how it is applied.</em> Where IQ focuses on the knowledge and ability to learn practical concepts (and measures this with a numerical score), EQ is focused on less tangible soft-skills. EQ and IQ are considered separate from one another, and as such a person could have a very high IQ, but be lacking in the soft-skills which would aid their relationships and day-to-day performance.
                
            <br><br><em>EQ is hugely important, because having an awareness of this concept and actively working to improve it can help move us towards more optimal states of living.</em> At Dev Academy and in the wider world it is inevitable that we will find ourselves in uncertain and difficult situations, often with the need to problem solve with individuals from many walks of life. Being aware of your own and other people’s emotions during these times can make these times more smooth to navigate and provide better outcomes for all parties involved.
