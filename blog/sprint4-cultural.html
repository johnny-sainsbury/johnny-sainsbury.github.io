            <br><br><em>Neuroplasticity is the scientific concept that the brain is not in a fixed state, but is actually malleable</em> – physically changing through experiences which create new neural connections. Understanding this can be of great benefit to people in learning environments because it adds some scientific reinforcement to the adage “practice makes perfect”. Essentially, if you practice something with consistency you can tangibly alter your brain to develop strength in this area.

            <br><br><em>To engage with this for your own benefit, it could be helpful to take stock of where you already are.</em> Asking a self-reflexive question such as “what areas of my brain have I developed with neuroplasticity?” could provide some insights and pointers for how to move ahead. Personally, I found that a lot of habits and understandings that feel natural to me are actually the outcome of repetition and practice. This can be for better or worse, as of course there are some learned frames of mind that are not beneficial to your own success or wellbeing. Taking time to explore where you are at now and what you want for the future could lay some useful foundations for what things you’d like to start consciously practicing and implementing quite literally into your brain.
                
            <br><br><em>Engaging with a mindfulness practice, which we discussed last week, is a powerful way to tap into your neuroplasticity and start using it to form good habits.</em> Keeping a mindful meditation practice regular can help reinforce its benefits of focus, awareness, and flow into more long term states of being via its reinforcement of the relevant neural pathways. This has been documented <u><a href="https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3477&context=honors_theses">here</a></u>.
                
            <br><br><em>Growth mindset is the application of neuroplasticity, typically within more of an educational context.</em> The crux of this idea is that your capacity to learn new concepts and develop new skills is not fixed, but again with regular practice, can develop and grow over time. This is particularly relevant in our context at Dev Academy. Most students will not have experience coding in an educational setting, and adopting a growth mindset can help us to take on these unfamiliar or challenging concepts. 
                
            <br><br><em>I was surprised to learn there are some common misconceptions about the growth mindset.</em> It’s not as simple or easy as just saying “I will have a growth mindset today”. In reality, we all have a mixture of fixed and growth mindsets, and an awareness of what triggers the fixed mindset and personal tools for addressing this is important to kick the growth mindset into gear. This has been discussed by Carol Deck <u><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/12/how-praise-became-a-consolation-prize/510845/">here</a></u>.
                
            <br><br><em>I will integrate the concept of neuroplasticity and the framework of the growth mindset into my learning in two main ways.</em> Firstly I will continue with my regular meditation practice, with the intent of bringing this into my day-to-day outlook of the world, and secondly I will look for signs of a fixed mindset trigger, as I now understand that this extra layer of awareness is an important component to achieving a growth mindset.
