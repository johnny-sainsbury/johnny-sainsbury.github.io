            <br><br><em>When I started Foundations at EDA I had a bit of resistance to this idea of “learning things about myself and my ego”.</em> It’s not that I don’t see the value in this, it’s actually kinda the opposite. I thought of myself as pretty self aware already (sometimes to my own detriment), and in my experience any push for more self awareness has made me feel a little wound up and over-extracted. You know when you’re done squeezing all the juice from a lemon, but you keep going anyway? You don’t get juice no more, just ugly bits of pulp falling over the salad. It felt like that. 

            <br><br>With that considered, the first thing that I learnt about myself during EDA foundations was this meta-idea that with the right type of push there’s actually more to learn about the self. Importantly, with the way Foundations was structured, the extra juice we got out of this lemon was actually really useful. The second thing I learnt was also kinda meta (sorry…). It’s that I don’t really know how to learn. Before I learn, I need to learn to learn. Classic Catch-22 stuff here, which brings us to the third insight. I can start learning how to learn. This process is far from done, but I feel like I’m right on track.
                
            <br><br><em>You could learn and program without self-awareness, values, and empathy, but I don’t think it would be pretty.</em> This stuff is tricky and it’s easy to default to insularity. Why do that though? When applied well those three pillars can open you up in the right ways to feedback in both directions. It can make a learning environment more open source, with information flowing organically and freely across people. I can only imagine that this would significantly up each individual’s potential.
                
            <br><br><em>During Core I was especially surprised to see the effectiveness of meditation in action.</em> This was yet another thing my ego blocked off at the start (I thought I already understood the benefits of that practice and applied them at least… enough). I tangibly noticed that I had better days, with more calm and focus, when I made a conscious effort to have a decent meditation session in the morning.
                
            <br><br><em>What challenged me the most during Core was this “learning how to learn” thing.</em> I’m from a professional background where you go in knowing what you need to know. If you don’t know you pick it up fast. If you can’t pick it up fast you’re out. This is pretty antithetical to the EDA way, but it’s drilled into me from a decade of “fashion stuff”. The Core curriculum allowed me to be open enough with myself to realise I’ve got to ditch those habits and get comfortable with the unknown, being vulnerable, trying and failing. It’s part of a process I haven’t got a lot of experience with, but I am starting to feel the benefits of. 
                
            <br><br><em>I can’t exactly speak for others, but I think I’d be in a pretty different situation now if Core wasn’t part of the EDA curriculum.</em> It’s given me the foundations to do the rest of my learning on, and I can’t really imagine how I’d be doing without them. I hope and imagine that my peers got some extra juice from their lemons too.
