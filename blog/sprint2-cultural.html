            <br><br><strong>BOOTCAMP.</strong>

            <br><br><em>My long term career goals remain fundamentally the same as when I first established my Learning Plan.</em> That is to say develop industry experience and learn best practice from peers (likely in a formal full-time position) before moving into freelance work. I want to season this process by helping people I am close to build out digital portfolios for their art as to stay engaged with the creative side of things that I enjoy and am naturally close to. I’m open to this all changing, especially given the current climate of the world. What’s really important to me though is that I have a robust set of technical skills which I can engage with in a nimble and practical way to support myself.

            <br><br><em>Looking ahead at Bootcamp one strength I would like to focus on is the application of technical concepts to real world product.</em> This might not be useful all the time, but in the right instances it could be really helpful - for example, my confidence in ecommerce best practice and the requirements of that industry could help guide myself and others to consider what elements of JavaScript would be valuable to master or dig into. Contrary to that, I think I have a tendency to stress when I feel like I can’t master something technical. I think finding a balance of persistence and knowing when to take a break will be important for me.

            <br><br><em>Non-technically, I expect that it will be a challenge for me to maintain energy over the course of Bootcamp.</em> Not for lack of enthusiasm or commitment, just in terms of the literal amount of brain power needed to take things in over a relatively short space of time. Of course there’s also the component of needing to balance this with social and music commitments. I’m aware and primed for this though! 

            <br><br><em>I would love to double down on my meditation practice while I’m at Bootcamp, because I see this as holistically beneficial.</em> It can help not only with the overall challenges of learning a new skill, but also finding balance and calm outside of EDA.

            <br><br><em>I would like to be supported by the Bootcamp team, among other things, through the extra perspective these people have.</em> As a student I don’t necessarily know what I don’t know, nor do I have total awareness of what is “normal” to struggle with or excel at in this environment. It’s really helpful to me when educators or leaders share their perspective freely so that they can identify blind spots in my progress, or strengths I might not be aware of that I could lean into.

            <br><br><em>I’m committed to maintaining my focus at Bootcamp and bringing my best self to campus every day.</em> It’s inevitable that there will be technical challenges, but if I’m on top of my work and not emotional/deterred by the difficulty of these I know they will be easier to get through. Of course, I will always act with empathy and kindness, as I know my peers and instructors will often be navigating similar challenges and need support too.

            <br><br><br><strong>FOUNDATIONS.</strong>

            <br><br><em>I have a background in working with ecommerce Shopify sites, but hit a bit of a plateau in terms of my technical abilities.</em> Considering this, one of my long term goals here is to develop a robust set of skills – to be able to create the types of websites I used to just manage and tinker with. Further to this, I am a visual person surrounded by a creative community, so being able to accurately bring ideas to life closely to how they have been concepted in someone’s mind is important to me. The career path I have outlined for using these skills is not set in stone, because of the world we live in it’s important to stay open minded and flexible. Currently though I envision working with a fairly well structured company in the presence of other developers, I would like to learn industry best-practices from peers. After that I would really like to move into full time freelance work. 

            <br><br><em>Some of the skills that are with me naturally are empathy and a curiosity in people.</em> Listening to and understanding whoever I’m with at the time is really important. I’m lucky to have a background working close-ish to the technology we use, and I think familiarity with this environment is also a skill. I can be limited by self doubt and stress at times, and other times I can struggle to maintain focus. With this considered I would like to develop human skills of calm, focus, and confidence while I am at Enspiral. 
            
            <br><br><em>I’m making a commitment to share my empathy freely with others at Dev Academy, and not to let stress and distractions hinder that.</em> This will collectively help us to learn from one another and foster a safe, happy, and productive educational environment. 
            
            <br><br><em>If I need help on a project or otherwise I will break the problem down into achievable tasks</em> and see if I can solve it through research and problem solving, then turn to my student peers for support beyond that, and my facilitators should I need anything further. 
            
            <br><br><em>From my facilitators I hope and expect to be treated with kindness and understanding.</em> I would like them to hold an awareness of not just my progress through the curriculum, but also how this relates to my unique goals and person. It would be great to be pushed towards challenges and learning that really excites me and to be pointed towards a relevant learning/career path via their insight and expertise. 
            
            <br><br><em>Outside of Dev Academy my structure is quite flexible.</em> I don’t have any structured commitments like pets or children - haha. I am however also very focused on my career as a DJ, and occasionally I will have gigs or need to take time to practice this. In a perfect world I would love to integrate my learning with Dev Academy into my music practice. I’m not sure how yet, but as these both involve creative & technical skills and refined use of software I hope we can think of something creative and fun here.
