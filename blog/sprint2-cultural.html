            <br><br><em>I have a background in working with ecommerce Shopify sites, but hit a bit of a plateau in terms of my technical abilities.</em> Considering this, one of my long term goals here is to develop a robust set of skills – to be able to create the types of websites I used to just manage and tinker with. Further to this, I am a visual person surrounded by a creative community, so being able to accurately bring ideas to life closely to how they have been concepted in someone’s mind is important to me. The career path I have outlined for using these skills is not set in stone, because of the world we live in it’s important to stay open minded and flexible. Currently though I envision working with a fairly well structured company in the presence of other developers, I would like to learn industry best-practices from peers. After that I would really like to move into full time freelance work. 

            <br><br><em>Some of the skills that are with me naturally are empathy and a curiosity in people.</em> Listening to and understanding whoever I’m with at the time is really important. I’m lucky to have a background working close-ish to the technology we use, and I think familiarity with this environment is also a skill. I can be limited by self doubt and stress at times, and other times I can struggle to maintain focus. With this considered I would like to develop human skills of calm, focus, and confidence while I am at Enspiral. 
            
            <br><br><em>I’m making a commitment to share my empathy freely with others at Dev Academy, and not to let stress and distractions hinder that.</em> This will collectively help us to learn from one another and foster a safe, happy, and productive educational environment. 
            
            <br><br><em>If I need help on a project or otherwise I will break the problem down into achievable tasks</em> and see if I can solve it through research and problem solving, then turn to my student peers for support beyond that, and my facilitators should I need anything further. 
            
            <br><br><em>From my facilitators I hope and expect to be treated with kindness and understanding.</em> I would like them to hold an awareness of not just my progress through the curriculum, but also how this relates to my unique goals and person. It would be great to be pushed towards challenges and learning that really excites me and to be pointed towards a relevant learning/career path via their insight and expertise. 
            
            <br><br><em>Outside of Dev Academy my structure is quite flexible.</em> I don’t have any structured commitments like pets or children - haha. I am however also very focused on my career as a DJ, and occasionally I will have gigs or need to take time to practice this. In a perfect world I would love to integrate my learning with Dev Academy into my music practice. I’m not sure how yet, but as these both involve creative & technical skills and refined use of software I hope we can think of something creative and fun here.
